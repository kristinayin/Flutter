<!-- WEEK 2 -->
## Week 2

<p>Assignments 1-3 are in the hello.dart file in the Week 2 folder.</p>

<li>Assignment 1</li>
  <ul>This assignment follows Challenge 5 in Chapter 2 of Dart Apprentice. The final print is shown below:</ul>
  <ul><img src="https://github.com/kristinayin/Flutter/blob/main/Week%202/assignment1.png" alt="assignment 1 week 2" width="70%" height="70%"></ul>
<li>Assignment 2</li>
   <ul>I created a method that takes in the angle (in degrees) and plugs it into the trig identity sin^2(x)+cos^2(x). The final print is shown below:</ul>
    <ul><img src="https://github.com/kristinayin/Flutter/blob/main/Week%202/assignment2.png" alt="assignment 2 week 2" width="70%" height="70%"></ul>
<li>Assignment 3</li>
  <ul>I created a 'story generator' that plugs in randomly selected keywords from lists (2 num lists and 6 string lists). The story is ~150 words (147 to be exact). This is one of the generated results:</ul>
  <ul><img src="https://github.com/kristinayin/Flutter/blob/main/Week%202/assignment3.png" alt="assignment 3 week 2" width="90%" height="90%"></ul>
<li>Assignment 4</li>
  <ul>I made sure to have comments throughout my code.</ul>
<li>Assignment 5</li>
  <ul>I added a login page with email and password fields and a login button to my pokemon app from last week (Week 1 folder).</ul>
  <ul><img src="https://github.com/kristinayin/Flutter/blob/main/Week%202/assignment5.gif" alt="gif pokemon app" width="30%" height="30%"></ul>
<li>Nice to have</li>
  <ul>I made sure all my variables followed the lowerCamelCase naming convention. In Assignment 3, instead of initializing 7 variables, I created 8 lists of num, String, etc. with options that my story will randomly pick.</ul>
